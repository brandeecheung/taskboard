# Task Board

## Project Goal

Create a task board application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery that allows a team to manage project tasks by modifying starter code. In addition, create a date picker using [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library. The cards within this application are draggable and droppable. The cards also feature a color dependent on status of the task card created. Each card features a delete button so you can clear old tasks from the board. 


The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
